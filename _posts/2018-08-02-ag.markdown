I want to talk about one of the more powerful tools in my toolbox - [Ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).  As a developer I'll bet you spend a fair amount of time writing code, but I'd argue you spend even more time reading code.  Having a solid understanding of your language's standard library, or a framework's core abstractions will no doubt come in handy, but if you're working on anything larger than a *Hello World* program chances are you spend a lot of time digging through code - lots of code.  This is where a code searching tool like Ag proves indespensible.  Yes, Ag can do your basic keyword searches, but so can your favorite editor.  I want to share some of the more advanced options I find myself using day-to-day to shine a light on just how powerful of a tool it can be.

*All examples will use [Flipper](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper) as an example codebase we can search through.  Feel free to `git clone https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper.git && cd flipper` to follow along!*


## Why Ag?

* fast...really fast (orders of magnitude faster than grep/ack)
* version control system awareness - ignores file patterns in your .gitignore
* ignores file patterns added to .ignore (eg .min.js)

## Install

`brew install ag`

# Basic Searching

`ag [file-type] [options] PATTERN [PATH]`

With one argument Ag recursively searches the current directory for the given pattern.

`ag Gate`

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/ag.png)

Pass it a second argument to recursively search a directory.  This becomes especially useful when working in an opinionated framework like Rails where I know all of my controller code lives under *app/controllers*, specs under *spec/controllers*,  etc.

`ag Gate spec`

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/ag-directory.png)

# Whole Word

Often we're searching for a pattern that appears in many different contexts within our app.  Usually this is a core domain concept like User, Property, or Gate.  We only want to hit on cases where this pattern is a whole word - meaning not a subset of a larger word.

`ag Gate`

*Note how `Gate` is matched, but so is `Flipper::GateNotFound` since it contains `Gate`.*

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/ag.png)

`ag -w Gate`

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/whole-word.png)

# File Type

`ag --ruby User`

`ag --js console`

Restrict search to specific file-type.  This is really useful if you have, for example, Ruby and JavaScript services that share the same name.

To see all supported file-types: `ag --list-file-types`.

# List

Ag returns the filename and line matching PATTERN.  Sometimes we just want to list the filenames.

`ag Gate -l`

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/list.png)

`ag Gate -l | sort` - *pro tip: who doesn't prefer a sorted list?*

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/ag-list-sort.png)

# File Pattern

Limit search to file names (including path) that contain a pattern:

`ag User -G controllers`

**Usecase:**

Your Rails and JavaScript admin panel code are both namespaced under an *admin* directory and you want to search both:

`ag User -G /admin/`

# Ignore Directory

`ag UserCreator --ignore-dir spec/`

`--ignore-dir` can be used to search everywhere, *except* a given directory.  Multiple directories can be ignored by repeating the option.

`ag User --ignore-dir spec/ --ignore-dir config/`.

# Piping

Ag reads from Standard Input, allowing us to pipe results into the filter.

**Usecase 1:** searching rails routes

In rails we can get an overview of all defined routes by running the `rake routes` task.  With thousands of routes and not enough coffee left in my mug this would take way too long to search through by hand.

`rake routes`

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/rake-routes.png)

`rake routes | ag sign_in`

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/rake-routes-ag.png)

**Usecase 2:** filtering logs

Have you ever tried to figure out which controllers actions are handling requests on page load?  Rails logs every request a controller processes.  With Ag we can easily filter for these messages:

`tail -f log/development.log`

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/tail.png)


`tail -f log/development.log | ag "Processing by"`

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/tail-ag.png)

**Usecase 3:** killing processes

Every once in a while I'll try to shut down an irb session by sending a SIGINT via *ctrl-c*, only to have the process fail to terminate.  When a process wants to play these kind of games there's only one option - SIGTERM baby!

Get the PID by listing running processes with `ps -ax`

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/ps.png)

Filter the results for any irb processes `ps -ax | ag irb`

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/irb.png)

`kill 78154`

# Regex

`ag [file-type] [options] PATTERN [PATH]`

We've mostly seen basic words as the PATTERN parameter.  It turns out PATTERN supports Perl-style regular expressions making Ag's searching capablities limitless.

**Usecase:** very specific searches

Let's search for every reference to the `Feature` class in files ending in *adapter.rb* or *store.rb*.

`ag -w -G "(adapter|store).rb$"`

![ag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/searching/regex.png)

# Context

`man ag | ag -C case`

Ag will display the line matching PATTERN, but sometimes we need some more context.  For this we can pass the context (-C) flag to print the 2 lines above and below each match. Note the difference between the above command and the result of `man ag | ag case`.

# EOF
This really just scratches the surface of the powers of Ag.  To learn more be sure to take a read through the man pages (`man ag`) in your shell of choice.

Happy ~~hacking~~ Ag-ing!
