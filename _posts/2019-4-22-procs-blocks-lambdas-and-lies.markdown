Github user supersam654 recently opened a great [issue](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/issues/405) on the Flipper repo after running into trouble trying to
register a group using Ruby's `&:method` shorthand.

![issue](/assets/ruby-arity-symbol-proc/issue.png)

Groups allow enabling features based on the return value of a block, which is passed the actor
when checking for enabledness.

# &:admin?

When Rubyists want to call a method on every member of an Enumerable we tend to avoid the extra keystrokes
needed to type out the whole block:

```ruby
["a", "b", "c"].map { |letter| letter.upcase }

#=> ["A", "B", "C"]
```

in favor of the more concise:


```ruby
["a", "b", "c"].map(&:upcase)

#=> ["A", "B", "C"]
```

This works with any Enumerable method that yields each member of the collection to the provided block.  If
this works with `map`, `each`, `select`, etc. why is supersam654 having trouble using it with
`Flipper.register`?  To answer this we're going to have to take a tour of some of the more advanced features
of Ruby.  Let's get started.


# Registering Groups

When a Flipper group is registered it stores the provided block in an instance variable `@block`.

Given a simplified version of `register`:

*[source](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/master/lib/flipper.rb#L84)*
```ruby
def register(name, &block)
  @block = block
end
```

When this code is executed:
```ruby
Flipper.register(:working) do |actor|
  actor.admin?
end
```

We end up with a gate instance that has a `match?` method locked and loaded, ready to check if a feature is enabled for an actor:

```ruby
 def register(name, &block)
   @block = block # { |actor| actor.admin? }
 end

def match?(thing, context)
  if @block.arity == 1 # @block = { |actor| actor.admin? }
    @block.call(thing)
  else
    @block.call(thing, context)
  end
end
```

When checking if a feature is enabled for a given user, `match?` eventually gets called with the user and optionally the context if your provided block takes two arguments .  The feature
is enabled for the user if the result of the block is true.

# Arity

```ruby
if @block.arity == 1 # @block = { |actor| actor.admin? }
  @block.call(thing)
else
  @block.call(thing, context)
end
```

Arity is the number of arguments a function takes (*Thanks [Wikipedia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity),
and screw you high school teacher who said Wikipedia was not a credible source for my essays!*).

Ruby, with
its powerful metaprogramming abilities lets us introspect any object we'd like *including* method objects.
Who said Ruby methods aren't first class citizens?  To figure out a method's arity we don't need
  any special wizardry we just need to politely ask it.

```ruby
def greet(person)
  "Nice to meet ya #{person.name}"
end

method(:greet).arity
# => 1

def introduce(person1, person2)
  "#{person1.name}, I'd like to introduce you to #{person2.name}"
end

method(:introduce).arity
# => 2
```

When a method takes a variable number of arguments `arity` returns *-n-1*, where *n* is the number of required arguments.
```ruby
def call(*people)
  people.each(&:call)
end

method(:call).arity
# => -1
```

Just like methods, procs and lambdas can also be asked their arity.

```ruby
proc { |arg| }.arity
# => 1

->(arg) { }.arity
# => 1

lambda {|*args| }.arity
# => -1
```

# Lies, Lies, and More Lies

I have to apologize for telling a slight lie earlier.  The register method doesn't just store the block in an
instance variable `@block`.  When `&` is prepended to a parameter like `&block` Ruby converts the provided block
to a proc, which allows us to reference it by dropping the ampersand. You can name this whatever you want e.g. `&foo`.  If passed an argument
prepended with `&` instead of a block, it converts the argument to a proc by calling `to_proc` on it.

```ruby
def register(name, &block)
  # Before giving us a refernce to block
  # Ruby implicitly calls: block = block.to_proc
  @block = block
end
```

When `register` is passed:

```ruby
register(:admin, &:admin?)
```

The following happens:
```ruby
def register(name, &:admin?)
  # block = :admin.to_proc  - Ruby calls this under the hood for us
  @block = block
end
```

And what would happen if we checked this *proc's* arity?

```ruby
def register(name, &block)
  # block = :admin.to_proc  - Ruby calls this under the hood for us
  @block = block
  puts @block.arity
end
```

```ruby
register(:admin, &:admin?)
# => -1

register(:admin) { |actor| actor.admin? }
# => 1
```

Hold up.  With the block the correct arity is returned, but with `&:admin?` -1 is returned! This explains why
`Flipper.register` is working with blocks, but not the `&:admin?` shortcut.

```ruby
def match?(thing, context)
  if @block.arity == 1
    @block.call(thing) # This path gets called with block
  else
    @block.call(thing, context) # This path gets called  with &:admin and raises an exception
  end
end
```

To figure out what exactly is happening here we'll need to keep on digging.

# I thought the following did the exact same thing...

```ruby
["a", "b", "c"].map { |letter| letter.upcase }
```

```ruby
["a", "b", "c"].map(&:upcase)
```

Almost, but not quite.  This is because `Symbol` implements its own version of [to_proc](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.0/Symbol.html#method-i-to_proc).

*simplified version of `Symbol#to_proc`. The real implementation is now written in C*
```ruby
class Symbol
  def to_proc
    proc { |arg| arg.send(self) }
  end
end
```
If we had a symbol such as `:upcase`,
when invoked:

```ruby
["a", "b", "c"].map { |letter| letter.upcase }
["a", "b", "c"].map(&:upcase) # same as the shorthand
```
we could replace these variables to see what it would actually look like:

```ruby
def to_proc
  proc { |arg| arg.send(self)
# proc { |letter| letter.send(:upcase) }
end
```

Now we understand what this `&:upcase` business is all about, but that still doesn't explain why the two
examples above aren't actually the same.  That's beacuse I've lied done it again! Another lie!  The real definition of
`Symbol#to_proc` looks more like this:

```ruby
class Symbol
  def to_proc
    proc do |*args|
      receiver, *rest = args
      if rest.nil?
        receiver.send(self)
      else
        receiver.send(self, *rest)
     end
    end
  end
end
```

As seen in our simplified example above `Symbol#to_proc` **always** returns a proc that takes a variable number of
arguments, while  blocks converted to procs via `&block` return procs that take the exact same number of
arguments as the block:

```ruby
def arity(&block)
  block.arity
end

arity() { |user| user.admin? }
# => 1

arity(&:to_s)
# => -1
```
This means that in the `&:admin?` case we end up in the else condition and pass arguments to
`admin?`, which expects 0. As always the computer does exactly what we tell it to do and not what we want it
to. The computer wins and an exception is raised.

```ruby
def match?(thing, context)
  if @block.arity == 1 # @block = { |actor| actor.admin? }
    @block.call(thing)
  else
    @block.call(thing, context) # this path gets called
  end
end
```

# Ruby friends to the rescue

Tim, being the legend that he is opened a PR using Sam's (also total legend - both of whom I've never actually met, but I'm sure they're legends) proposed idea to take the absolute value of the arity in match.

Since this has been merged it should be going out in the next release after 0.16.2.  As always check out the

# Follow Up

If you thought this was a fun dive into some parts of Ruby you may not have explored I encourage you to
experiment and implement your own to_proc method.  Think of some ways you can make it more powerful.  I'll get
you started:

```ruby
class String
  def to_proc
    proc { |arg| arg.send(self) }
  end
end

["a", "b", "c"].map(&"upcase")
```
