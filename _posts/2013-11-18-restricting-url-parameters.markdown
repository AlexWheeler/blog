I’m working on a job board for Boston area residents to post odd jobs for
college students to complete.

 When a user is filling out the form to post a new job they must decide which
category their job falls under. For example if a user needs a student to help
them with moving furniture they select the Moving category.  If they need a
babysitter for the weekend they select the Child Care category.  Since category
is an attribute of a job object I am able to query for jobs according to
category.

I have a dynamic route at `/:category` that directs users to the index action of
the jobs controller and sets `params[:category]` to `/:category`.

*routes.rb*

```ruby
match "/:category", to: "jobs#index", as: :category
```

The header tag for the index view is dynamic to be params[:category].  For
example if a user navigates to */Moving* the index view is displayed with header
Moving, listing all of the moving jobs.

This is great! A user can find jobs based on a certain category by visiting
`/:category` and easily tell which jobs they are viewing by looking at the large,
bold header or the url.

Then I came across a problem.  Since the route and and header tags were dynamic
the user could pass any value into the url and my job board had no way of
determining if this was a valid category or not.  Users would be directed to a
view with a header matching params[:category] whether it was a valid category
or not.

Let’s say the user navigated to */Foo*. They would see the index view with a
header Foo and a blank table.

I needed to come up with a way to validate that a category was valid or not.
My Job Board had to know that *moving* was a valid category and *foo* was not.

Luckily for me I had been playing around with a lot of methods that Ruby’s
[Enumerable Module](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Enumerable.html) provides us with and remembered an awesome `include` method.  You can call `include` on any collection and pass it a parameter, and
ruby checks if the collection contains this parameter.  It returns a boolean
value, true if it does include the value, and false if it does not.

Perfect! All I need to do is make a collection of all of the valid categories,
iterate through it and check to see if it includes `params[:category]`.  So, I
did exactly that.

*jobs_controller.rb*

```ruby
def index
  categories - %w(child-care computer-help general home-services
									moving party-help-catering research-focus-group yardwork)
  if categories.include?(params[:category])
    @jobs = Job.where(category: params[:category])
  else
    render "jobs/not_a_category_error"
  end
end
```

I added an array to the index action of the jobs controller, checked to see if
the category was valid, and used a conditional statement to dictate where to
direct the user .  If the value is a valid category (returns true) it lists all
of the jobs of the given category.  If the value is not a valid category
(returns false) the user is redirected to an error page.

*not_a_category_error.html.erb*

Part II: Refactoring

Great, everything is working.  Now time for some refactoring.  Rails has many
conventions or best practices, one of which is known as “skinny controller, fat
model.”  Following this convention, I decided to extract the categories into
the Job model and make it a constant.

*job.rb*

```ruby
class Job < ActiveRecord::Base
  CATEGORIES = %w(child-care computer-help general home-services
							 	  moving party-help-catering research-focus-group yardwork)
```

Now I am able to access this constant using Ruby’s :: operator and do the same
sort of validation as before.

*jobs_controller.rb*

```ruby
def index
  if Job::CATEGORIES.include?(params[:category])
    @jobs = Job.where(category: params[:category])
  else
    render "jobs/not_a_category_error"
  end
end
```
