Interning at [ChallengePost](https://devpost.com/) has truly been a dream come true.  I get to work
alongside an extremely talented team, ship production code multiple
times/day, and and truly be a part of the team.  I’ve been fortunate enough
to be a part of an awesome hacker community at BU and Boston in general.
Just about everything I know regarding programming, up until recently, has
come from hacking on fun projects with friends and hanging around the
generous [Boston Ruby](http://bostonrb.org/) community.  While these experiences have no doubt helped
me grow as a developer, there really is nothing that will take your
programming skills to the next level like a solid internship working on
interesting problems alongside a talented team of passionate developers 40
hours/week.

It has been about a month since I began my summer with [hackNY](http://hackny.org/) building the
future of hackathons with ChallengePost and I couldn’t be happier with where
I’m at.  In the past month alone I have learned enough to easily fill blog
posts for the next semester or two, however, as disappointing as it might
sound, I do have a life outside of the internet and because of this I don’t
think I will be able to post about everything I have learned.  With that
being said, I do strongly believe in sharing the things I have learned
because I know that I wouldn’t be where I’m at today if it weren’t for those
who were generous enough to pass on their knowledge to me.  My plan for the
rest of summer is to post about the things I have found the most interesting,
as both a way for you as the reader to gain some knowledge as well as for
myself to go a bit deeper on those things that I find most interesting.

We have to start somewhere so how about we start with something really fun:
servers!
